        <h3>How did this happen?</h3>
        <p>I wrote my first programs in the sixth grade, which involved lots of cin, cout and looping arrays,
        and that's. After a small detour that led to focusing on bio in high-school I realized that labs are not my thing
        and spontaneously (even though it seemed the more sensible thing to do) I decided to verge into coding again. </p>
        <h3>Now what?</h3>
        <p>It is becoming more and more apparent to me that coding is cool and so are things like numbers, languages and gadgets. 
        So improving Siri could be a nice side project... just kidding - AIs and non robotic computer voices are hard to make but I try my luck one day. Oh, and the airport industry is complicated. How about some BIG data?</p>
