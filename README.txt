It seems that everything was implemented correctly. Out of my desire to use correct semantics I had to give up styling the top level list entries under “professional experience” since that would style the sub-list. Since the styling in question was a background color that was unacceptable. This could’ve been avoided by embedding the top level list items *text* into another tag that can be then styled independently but I wasn’t sure if that’s ok..

I did not find a nice professional looking portrait photo, so instead you’ll see a picture of a train station in Vienna at night.

~10 hours went into finishing this.
